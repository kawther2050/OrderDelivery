# OrderDelivery

Project Overview

This project is a C++ console-based application that implements an Order Management System using a circular queue data structure. It allows users to manage customer orders by adding new orders, serving and removing existing ones, viewing the next or last order in line, displaying all current orders, searching for a specific order by ID, and canceling orders.


The system operates through a simple menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly for basic order queue operations. The code is modular and well-structured, with function such as addOrder, removeOrder, display, search, and cancelOrder. The queue is implemented using a static array with a fixed size (defined by the MAX constant), and careful logic is used to manage the circular nature of the queue efficiently

To run this program, users need to compile the DataProject.cpp file using a C++ compiler like g++, and then execute the compiled file from a terminal.
